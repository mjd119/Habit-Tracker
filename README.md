# Research Methods Tutorial and Habit Tracker
A Google App Engine project to teach Research Methods and to act as a habit tracker

To Do Items:
1. Preventing users from going back to the research design pages after they create it.
2. Creating a graph with user-submitted data (graph creation still works with hard-coded data).
     2a. Not sure what you would like to have when user doesn't have var4 and/or var5
     2b. Not sure what you would like to have when the user has gaps between reports
3. Fixing an issue where the input sections are not copied and pasted in the Fifth Variable (Alternative Cause 3) accordion and the Dependent Variable Accordion panel bodies. Don't have the issue when there is no third variable, 1 third variable, or 2 third variables. Try checking console logs and any differences between HTML sections for each variable. I apologize that I didn't find this issue earlier. I thought the code was parallel between accordions and their contents. I suspect that the issue has to do with the var5 accordion and its descendants (either the HTML or the JavaScript).
