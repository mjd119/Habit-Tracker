<h3><center>Boto Example:</center></h3>
<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>
This page provides demonstrations of a couple functions of boto. In theory any MTurk operation can be achieved by calling different functions. The documentation for the MTurk Operations and their implementations in Boto are available from the following sites:
<a href="http://boto.cloudhackers.com/en/latest/ref/mturk.html#">Boto</a>
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI/ApiReference_OperationsArticle.html">MTurk</a>.



<p>
Before you can access your MTurk account, you must obtain your Amazon Web Service (AWS)
access_key aka AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and your secret_key aka AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. This is like your user name and password. These need to be put into the app.yaml file as environment variables. Information for how to find these credentials can be found <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html">here</a>.

<p>
Amazon has built a 'sandbox' that allows developers to test code in a test environment. Any code executed in this environment does not actually withdraw fees from the MTurk account and MTurk workers will not accept the hits. Once you are ready to publish the site, all you need to do is change one line of code in /boto/connection.py line 950 to use the production site instead of the sandbox.

<h4>Account Balance:</h4>
<p>
This code retrieves the account balance from MTurk. If the sandbox is being used, it should always display a balance of $10,000.

<b>Account Balance: </b>{{AccountBalance}}
